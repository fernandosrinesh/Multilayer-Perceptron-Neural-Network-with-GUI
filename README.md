# Multilayer-Perceptron-Neural-Network-with-GUI
Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (Clean Coded) with GUI for binary classification using python
Implementation has been done for Bank marketing dataset and breast cancer dataset.

Instructions to run the program: First upload one of the given datasets and select Preprocessing button then select Show values to view the dataset then  in the textbox
put no of layers and neurons on each layer you want below it has shown that 3 hidden layers with 10 neurons on each was given.
